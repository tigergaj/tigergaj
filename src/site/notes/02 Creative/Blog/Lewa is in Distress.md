## Howdy
My name is Lewa! Fragments would come and go and I could never quite describe myself in a way that satisfied that itch of knowing who I am. But now, more than ever, I know what I need to say I know what I am. I am is in distress and I need help. I am traumatized by the cold shoulder of a family who would sooner throw me away than accept who I am. I am a 25 year old queer artist escaping an abusive evangelical family. This is a huge change and I need support now more than I ever.
## Whatâ€™s up with me
Due to the nature of the abuse inflicted upon me, I have a very difficult time asking for help. My ability to live my own life has been taken from me to the greatest extent that it can and Iâ€™m very exhausted. My deadline for being out of my abuserâ€™s house is the end of November.
## What you can do!
Firstly I ask that if you or someone you know needs a roommate, do get in touch!! My goal is to move to albany Iâ€™m always happy to entertain an inquiry, I have some current leads and a backup if I canâ€™t find anyone, but I would like to at least stay in New York in the Hudson Valley, Albany (or even NYC) to make moving out easier and quicker.

You can message me through one of the platforms below, and if youâ€™d rather catch me through my phone number, then feel free to ask in the dms! If you would like to donate, feel free to DM me about that, however, [my Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/tigergaj) is public if youâ€™d like to donate there. All I ask is that you humbly consider whether this website Iâ€™ve been creating over the past year is worth a tip according to whatever amount of subjective value itâ€™s provided to you. And if youâ€™re at all worried about your own financial state then thereâ€™s nothing wrong with selfishly enjoying something you get for free! I want to create out in the open and believe deeply in the free distribution of information and I plan on keeping it that way. So if you witnessed this sucker giving away faer feelings for free on the internet and could spare the chump change; then I would be deeply appreciative.

## I love myself now, more than ever
All things considered, I am very stressed out, but very excited for the future. I see the light at the end of the tunnel, and it feels so good to finally know that I have a way out. I am extremely proud of myself for getting this far. Iâ€™ve started journaling and going on daily walks and trying my best to take care of myself. I cannot wait to push my true potential to the limits and 

With love for myself and whoever reads this,
