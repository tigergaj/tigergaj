## Intro
Okay so me and my friend Heartbeat won these destiny coats from beating the week one raid on the ice moon of Jupiter: Europa. The raid was titled: "Deep Stone Crypt" and it was like space scientists explore and establish base of operations on ice planet type beat. So lonely and barren and empty and frozen. it's such a beautiful area in a video game. Anyways.

Our coats are like, canonically loot that we won and spawned in real life. and we just have these coats. We are tundra scientists and we genuinely use these all the time when we want to just not be cold. they are so toasty, especially when paired with proper gear.

So when we started looking for a bong and found [[02 Creative/Blog/The Apparatus/The Apparatus\|The Apparatus]]; We knew immediately that this is the one.

## Original Instructions
this guide is decent and it has some great ideas, but it's lacking style and precision. We need an easily replicable process that we can practice and refine to complete in a satisfactory amount of time. Currently it takes us about 30 minutes to an hour.

## The Procedure
this is our improved guide. it's not necessarily inaccurate to the original instructions, but rather, based on them and much more scientific and specific.
### WARNING: GLOVES
It is recommended to use gloves while doing [[#The Procedure]].
### Cleaning Solution
The solution is a mixture of 99% isopropyl alcohol and coarse sea salt. We're currently using x brand sea salt and 70% isopropyl alcohol, found in a common grocery store.
### Steps
1. Pour out the water in the [[#Water Chamber]].
2. Remove bowl, plug one end with a finger and add a small amount of [[#Cleaning Solution]] and shake. if [[#Bowl]] is still dirty then pour solution into a cup and submerge [[#Bowl]]and let sit for 15 minutes.
3. Remove [[#Bracket]] and detach the [[#Glycerin Tube]] from the [[#Water Chamber]].
4. Add an arbitrary amount of the[[#Cleaning Solution]] to the [[#Water Chamber]].
5. Assemble [[02 Creative/Blog/The Apparatus/The Apparatus\|The Apparatus]] without the [[#Bowl]] and attach the [[#Bracket]]. Once secure, plug both ends with fingers and shake [[02 Creative/Blog/The Apparatus/The Apparatus\|The Apparatus]] aggressively until satisfied. Rinse and repeat as many times as necessary.
6. (optional step) after a heavy smoke, it is recommended to let the [[#Water Chamber]] sit with solution in it for 15 minutes as well
7. rinse all [[#Components]] with water and allow to fully dry before storage. Do NOT place the [[#Glycerin Tube]] in cold place to freeze until completely dry.
# Reflections
we've been really fucking with the idea of [[modularity\|modularity]] recently. a system to using out new bong that's scientific and has steps so that we have an easy to reference guide for cleaning the bong. the pieces pull apart in a certain way, and we out it together again. such a satisfying little toy but it also gets you fkn schblasted.
