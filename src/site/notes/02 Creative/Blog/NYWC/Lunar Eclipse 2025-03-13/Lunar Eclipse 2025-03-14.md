## Luna
The hard work has been done and we climbed the mountain and experienced the blood moon while the shadow of the Earth was most covering the moon. 

Here is a great website that visualizes a bit better what you are actually looking at [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/in/usa/new-york?iso=20250314)
and lastly, these pictures opposite to chronological. so the most recent are the newest pictures, with an exception of the very first one. The next 7 after that are Mason's pictures with his iPhone 10 camera through the telescope, and the rest are mine. I have a few that are telescope pics but I'm not fully used to dark lighting and mastering the levels with my new camera app, but a lot of my pics are focused on documenting the event and the happenings, and not getting pictures of the moon itself, but rather, the progression. we called it a night somewhere near the end of the darkness.
