#### Forward
Okay, so my friend started playing this game on his Xbox called "Crypt of the Serpent King" (no, I'm not kidding, that's *really* what it's called). it is possibly the bear minimum bargain bin asset dump that it looks like, but I am telling you, an army of ***nerds*** has gone to the reviews section on xbox and showered it with love. What to do? my friend, *demanded* that I play this game. So, months later, new computer built in my house and all my games downloaded on my *pristine* new linux workstation/gaming pc hybrid; I got to playing. I could have been playing Elden Ring, which has been said is the game of the year that I absolutely need to play and understand. BUT I decided to play this, and it's been worth it.

I am not kidding, I believe it to be a genuinely amazing audio-visual experience. There's so much you can do to optimize. I'm thinking about looking at speedruns. Also the music is so good.
## Hard Mode is *Really* Hard
There are three difficulties. I have not even tried casual since I started playing with my own install. Normal Mode offered a challenge, but the tolerances were a little too forgiving for me and I basically beat the last five out of seven levels in an evening. But then I got to hard. And I'd like to talk about it. 

You bet you ass that the achievement for completing level seven on hard is getting pinned on my steam profile.

### level three pit cheese
In level three in the rooms with the pedestals with the keys, the lava moat from level one and the fire pipes from level two is replaced with a giant pit with spikes in the bottom. The orcs can follow you past it and you can safely hit them while you stand still on the island in the middle.

## I'm pretty sure enemies have regen
I'm 90% certain that I've determined that common enemies almost always take three hits, but they sometimes take four. it usually takes be off guard, but I've noticed that it always happens during a long fight. but it's possible that damage is changed by some other variable, such as distance.

This on hard mode, this adds a whole dimension of uncertainty.

*Which brings me into my next point...*
## This Game is Genuinely Terrifying.
Whether my experience was intended by the developers or not, *I do not care.* This game scares me regardless. On hardcore, you cannot heal. That means that every hit is just another step closer to starting a run all over again. So I check every corner carefully. Fighting two enemies while roaming the dungeon is practically a death sentence.

Every time you turn a corner you have to pay attention. If you come to an intersection, you need to creep both corner and see if there's an enemy because if you walk out without thinking then you might aggro two at once and then you're boned.
