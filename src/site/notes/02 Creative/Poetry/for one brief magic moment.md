I often feel bad, very often, in fact.
In fact, much of the time I spend breathing is spent feeling bad.

I want to feel better, I want to blossom and grow like I've been told I will.
But I'm stuck.
I'm stuck thinking about one brief magical moment.

that was the peak, I'd not felt better than that in my entire life, 
and I am scared that I'll never feel it again, and then I am sad

for one brief magic moment
I was safe, I was warm
in the warmth of the sun
in the gaze of the moon
I was loved
for one brief magic moment

I don't know if that moment will ever come back
maybe I've felt the most I'll ever feel
