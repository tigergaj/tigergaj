The Monster creates
The Monster listens and waits
The Monster lies and decieves
The Monster is looking for a victim
The Monster is loooking for blood
The Monster is looking for Me

The Angel is hurt
The Angel is hiding and crying
The Angel says "you don't have to do this"
The Angel says "You're crazy"
The Angel sees The Monster
The Monster found Me
You know what happened next

Moss Thief

I would get lost in her eyes the most
her voice an ocean of intoxicating clouds
her locks guiding me
from her neck
to her lips
to those eyes
Iâ€™d let those hungry eyes consume me
I could spend years wondering
I could spend a lifetime chasing those eyes

but I won't
after all, itâ€™s awfully embarrassing to be burgled
she got her moss, I have plenty of it
I wanted to give her a forest full of it
but I wonâ€™t

and one evening
those eyes wanted my moss
and just like that
she took my moss
I let her take it, I'd do anything for those eyes
I helped her steal my moss from me
but not anymore

The birds continue singing
*deep down some part of me is garbled and screaming*
The sun keeps setting
*Every time I stop to think, I become paralyzed*
The birds continue singing
*If she couldn't love me, maybe I'm worthless*
The trail remains unwalked
*I'm hungry, but eating won't make me feel better*
Another moon
*often on the verge of tears but unable to let it out*
The grass continues growing
*I don't know what I want anymore*
The raspberries continue tasting sweet
*I'm scared*
The birds continue singing

## Dear Luna

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/02 Creative/Poetry/Dear Luna/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">




Dear Luna,

Last time I saw you I wished for everything to be okay
And once again, like the sparkle in the eyes of a pretty girl; I believed you
Just like anyone else, I wonder if youâ€™re listening
Just like anyone else, I wonder if you care
I felt safe when you were with me, and alone when you went away
I felt hope when I spoke to you, and despair when I saw you again
because thereâ€™s still something broken on the inside
because I still feel lost, I still feel enchanted by you, I still feel hurt.

goodbye Luna, see you next month

~ Lewa <3

## crying feels good

crying feels good

crying let's me know that I am not an emotionless golem

crying let's me know I will be okay

I am safe when I cry

crying is when I feel the love of myself rushing in

crying is when I know that things are at their worst, and it's only uphill from here

crying says that life is not hopeless 

crying says that this world sees me and that I am a part of it

crying is the best feeling there is

## For one brief magic moment

I often feel bad, very often, in fact.
In fact, much of the time I spend breathing is spent feeling bad.

I want to feel better, I want to blossom and grow like I've been told I will.
But I'm stuck.
I'm stuck thinking about one brief magical moment.

that was the peak, I'd not felt better than that in my entire life, 
and I am scared that I'll never feel it again, and then I am sad

for one brief magic moment
I was safe, I was warm
in the warmth of the sun
in the gaze of the moon
I was loved
for one brief magic moment

I don't know if that moment will ever come back
maybe I've felt the most I'll ever feel

Let me ask you a riddle

I often wonder why I don't cry more
I was born a happy child
I feel so strongly, all the time

what am I? 

I wonder why I didn't cry today
raised by someone with a piece missing
anger, sadness, grief, love, pain, hate

what am I? 

I wonder why I'm not crying now.
I feel like I have a piece missing
I feel alone

what am I?
