Let me ask you a riddle

I often wonder why I don't cry more
I was born a happy child
I feel so strongly, all the time

what am I? 

I wonder why I didn't cry today
raised by someone with a piece missing
anger, sadness, grief, love, pain, hate

what am I? 

I wonder why I'm not crying now.
I feel like I have a piece missing
I feel alone

what am I?
