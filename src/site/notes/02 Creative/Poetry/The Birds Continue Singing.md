The birds continue singing
*deep down some part of me is garbled and screaming*
The sun keeps setting
*Every time I stop to think, I become paralyzed*
The birds continue singing
*If she couldn't love me, maybe I'm worthless*
The trail remains unwalked
*I'm hungry, but eating won't make me feel better*
Another moon
*often on the verge of tears but unable to let it out*
The grass continues growing
*I don't know what I want anymore*
The raspberries continue tasting sweet
*I'm scared*
The birds continue singing
