Moss Thief

I would get lost in her eyes the most
her voice an ocean of intoxicating clouds
her locks guiding me
from her neck
to her lips
to those eyes
Iâ€™d let those hungry eyes consume me
I could spend years wondering
I could spend a lifetime chasing those eyes

but I won't
after all, itâ€™s awfully embarrassing to be burgled
she got her moss, I have plenty of it
I wanted to give her a forest full of it
but I wonâ€™t

and one evening
those eyes wanted my moss
and just like that
she took my moss
I let her take it, I'd do anything for those eyes
I helped her steal my moss from me
but not anymore
