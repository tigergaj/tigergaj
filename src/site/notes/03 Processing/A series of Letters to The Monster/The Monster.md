The Monster creates
The Monster listens and waits
The Monster lies and decieves
The Monster is looking for a victim
The Monster is loooking for blood
The Monster is looking for Me

The Angel is hurt
The Angel is hiding and crying
The Angel says "you don't have to do this"
The Angel says "You're crazy"
The Angel sees The Monster
The Monster found Me
You know what happened next
