## Impermanence
Shortly following the release of Destiny 2, the playerbase had leveled their characters and collected some new shiny loot. Then the first raid for destiny 2 launched. It was called "The Leviathan". A massive white and gold ship with a mouth designed to devour small planets has entered the sol, approaching Nessus. An individual by the title Emperor Calus has created this vessel to grind planets down to dust to make galactic wine. He wears his hedonism on his sleeve. The entire ship is gold plated.

But if you read the lore books, you'll find that Calus had not simply stumbled upon being the emperor of a self sustaining loyalist faction surviving bountifully in deep space. The Sword from the raid titled "[It Stared Back](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/it-stared-back#emperor-calus)" has a lore tab, and it delivers a catalyst for why he started building his magnificent Empire.

Calus had been cast out of the society of his species with his loyalists and left to drift in space for eternity. But he found what he describes as "The Black Edge", and it stared back. In the story of destiny there are later clarifications as to what this black edge actually was, but I find the symbolism of a perfect black edge of darkness that you inevitably reach to be a powerful allegory for death. Meeting this darkness is what invigorated Calus to become the character that you actually meet as the final boss on the Leviathan. He welcomes and encourages you to explore his ship, fight his crew to the throne room and kill him. He's doing his best to smell the flowers.

## Heat Death
Everything you've ever known or loved or hated will one day be dust. Every person you've ever known, all your thoughts and aspirations and emotions. It's all slowly drifting toward that infinite deep and there's no stopping it. Calus found a way to be somewhat immortal through some form of cloning and brain technology, but he too realized that he was just buying time for the inevitable. Calus decided that life is what you make of it, and he decided to make a lot.

This concept of an unavoidable end to everything is a real idea widely accepted by scientists of all kinds. It's called the "Heat Death of the Universe". The idea of a universal "heat death" is based on some very simple principles of physics. Firstly, the universe is expanding, and it shows no signs of stopping. And secondly, when two particles bump into one another, energy is transferred from one to the next. On a human scale, we recognize this idea as heat transfer. The idea is that slowly, over time, nothing will be able to escape the absolute dissolution of all heat and particles into a perfect, even layer that continues to spread out for infinity. The universe will be completely homogeneous, at least at the center. And then as time goes on, every particle and wave will be so far apart that there may as well be nothing at all.
## Freedom
Do not allow loss to toy with your emotions. The nature of things is that you lose them. It is literally impossible to not lose something. It will happen one day or another. If someone gives you a gift and you lose it, do not worry! You were going to lose it one day regardless, whether that be tomorrow or the day you die.

Following the year one Destiny 2 release, an expansion later that year titled Curse of Osiris added a "raid lair" to the Leviathan. This meant new loot and that meant new lore tabs on the loot and thusly we get the entry; [I am Alive](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/i-am-alive). Calus has found purpose, and he is enjoying his bounty. 

*"How could I have missed this? It's the small moments, the simple pleasures that matter. They're all I can think about now. Food and drink aren't mere sustenance. They're a reminder that I am alive.*"

Calus is right. Some tell me that constant reminders of impermanence causes them to feel despair. I find no such despair in it. I treat my time like a budget, I only have so much of it and I get to spend it on whatever I want. Not only does this mentality free me from worry, but it allows me to make progress. Time can only move forward, you will never know all the variables, so don't let them control you. Be like Emperor Calus, smell the flowers. ðŸª»
