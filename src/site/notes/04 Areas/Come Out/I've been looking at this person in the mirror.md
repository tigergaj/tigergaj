I've been looking at this person in the mirror. but I haven't taken any pictures of them. I've been constantly thinking about the subjectivity of gender and I'm gonna be honest, the more I detach myself from it, the happier I am.

## It feels good to accept what I see 

*"I am whatever that is"*, I'll accept that I am that creature looking back at itself, 0.0000000061 seconds in the past. I could not predict the future, but I am in this moment, and the next time I look in a mirror the person looking back at me will be different. 

Maybe another burn mark, maybe a haircut that the person writing this enjoys, maybe not. We all have things that we like and dislike about our bodies, and it's not fair to the person in your mirror if you do not accept them. There are things that we cannot change, and that is simply the bedrock of reality. Focus on the things that you can change, the person you could tangibly be. 

And the person in the present will love the person in the mirror, because that is the only thing left to do.
